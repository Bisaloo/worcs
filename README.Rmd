The Workflow for Open Reproducible Code in Science (WORCS) is an easy to adopt approach to ensuring a research project meets the requirements of Open Science from the start. It is based on a "good enough" philosophy, prioritizing user-friendliness over exhaustiveness. It can be used either in absence of, or in parallel to, existing requirements for Open workflows. It can also be enhanced with more elaborate solutions for specific issues.

## Where do I start?

For most users, the recommended starting point is to read [the preprint paper, available on the Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/zcvbs/).

The paper describes the WORCS workflow, and how the `worcs` package fits into that workflow.

## About this repository

This repository contains the following:

1.  An R-package called `worcs`, with convenience functions to facilitate the WORCS workflow.
2.  In the subfolder `./paper`, the source files for the paper describing the WORCS workflow.

The repository serves two functions: To allow users to install the `worcs` package, and to allow collaborators access to the source code for the package and paper.

```

## Installing the package

Before installing the package, please read [this vignette](https://cjvanlissa.github.io/worcs/articles/setup.html), which explains how to set up your computer for `worcs`.

After reading [the vignette](https://cjvanlissa.github.io/worcs/articles/setup.html), you can install the development version of the `worcs` package from GitHub with:

``` r
if(!requireNamespace("remotes"))install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("cjvanlissa/worcs", dependencies = TRUE, update = "never")
remotes::install_github("crsh/papaja", dependencies = TRUE, update = "never")
tinytex::install_tinytex()
worcs::git_user("your_name", "your_email")
```

## Citing WORCS

You can cite WORCS using the following citation (please use the same citation for either the package, or the paper):

## Contributing and Contact Information

The WORCS paper and `worcs` package are open to contributions from collaborators with valuable expertise, to improve both the workflow and the package. Relevant contributions warrant coauthorship to the paper or package. Please contact the lead author at [c.j.vanlissa@uu.nl](mailto:c.j.vanlissa@uu.nl), or:
