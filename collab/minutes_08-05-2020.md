# Mission statements for our projects

WORCS:
  * One-click solution to get everything set up on YOUR SYSTEM for a project that meets all TOP/FAIR requirements for Open Science
* Minimal effort, just good enough

REPRO:
  * Start from the goal of strict reproducibility, then work to make it more and more userfriendly
* Has a one click solution, like worcs
* Also has use_this type solution
* Checks for dependencies and recommendations on how to install them (see: has_git() in worcs?)
* automate commands: yaml headers for what data and scripts they need
* make file linked to Build button to run entire project

# How do these packages relate to each other

worcs interfacing with REPRO:
  * CJ
- Picking up that project and dropping it into a time capsule
- I think people are likely to move from worcs to repro
- I think it's less likely that people will move the other way
* AP:
    - People should start with worcs (should be standard)
	- Not ideal to switch package
	- Move internals to repro in modular fashion

## Roadmap for repro/worcs interface

1. Modularize worcs
2. Absorb into repro
3. Make worcs package depend on repro and be a "facade" for it

# Next steps

* Prepare codebook for compatibility with user-defined description, and machine-readable variable categories (talk with Frank Bosco from MetaBUS)
* remove git dependency (CJ: Perhaps I disagree... git is pretty essential to a reproducible workflow)
* redoc for collaborators
* Use intall (the package) instead of remotes

Troubleshooting:
* ZIP: Aaron has linux, install zip lib on travis
* Tests - failing, cleanup examples
* Icon, great idea

# Logistics of Collaboration
* Feel free to make minor bug fixes in eachother's packages
* Please debug your own functions and add tests
* Reciprocal contributions
