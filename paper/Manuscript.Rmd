# Introduction

The social sciences are amidst a paradigm shift towards open science. Several immediate causes stirred up support for this transition; including several highly publicized cases of scientific fraud, increasing awareness of questionable research practices, and the replication crisis. However, Open science is not merely a cure for this crisis - it is also an opportunity. Technological advances now enable us to perform reliable, cumulative, collaborative science more easily. Capitalizing on these advances has the potential to accellerate scientific progress. This paper introduces WORCS: Workflow for Open, Reproducible Code in Science. WORCS is a lightweight approach to open science and computational reproducibility. It is easy to implement, and still ensures reproducibility in most circumstances. Adoption is further facilitated by the availability of a WORCS project template.

# Defining Open Science

One of the most impactful contributions to Open Science has been the development of the TOP-guidelines, and the effort to urge publishers to adopt them. WORCS defines the goals of Open Science in terms of the eight standards described in the TOP-guidelines: Comprehensive citation of literature, data, materials, and methods (1); data sharing (2), sharing code required to reproduce analyses (3), sharing new research materials (4), and design and analysis (5); pre-registration of studies before data collection (6), and pre-registration of the analysis plan prior to analysis (7); and replication of published results (8). WORCS helps researchers meet each of these guidelines, with one exception: We do not address replication of published results, because that pertains to the topic of research, instead of its execution. We group the remaining seven guidelines into three categories: Citation (1), sharing (2-5), and preregistration (6-7).

## Goal of this paper

The TOP-guidelines are primarily geared towards top-down systemic change (what's in a name) by Journals, funders, and organizations. Yet the value of grassroots change should not be underestimated. Many individual researchers are willing to adopt best practices for Open Science, even in the absence of institutional support. The goal of this paper is therefore to present a workflow that can help individual scientists to meet the principles of Open Science. This workflow can be used regardless of any top-down Open Science requirements already implemented by journals and institutions: If such requirements exist, this workflow will help fulfill them, and if they do not exist,

## Existing solutions

There have been several previous efforts to promote grass-roots adoption of Open Science principles. Each of these efforts has a different scope, strengths, and limitations that set it apart from WORCS. For instance, @aalbersbergMakingScienceTransparent2018 suggested publishing a "TOP-statement" as supplemental material, which discloses the authors' adherence to Open Science principles. This is very easy to implement, and addresses TOP-guidelines 1-7. A limitation of this approach, which WORCS addresses, is that it does not clarify *how* researchers can meet the TOP-guidelines. One could use WORCS to meet the TOP-guidelines, and document this in a TOP-statement. A second relevant source is @peikertReproducibleDataAnalysis2019, who describe a workflow for reproducible analyses. Being limited to computational reproducibility, this workflow only addresses TOP-guidelines 2, 3, and 5. Peikert and Brandmaier aim to achieve strict computational reproducibility by conducting analyses on a virtual machine, that can be stored like a sort of time capsule and reinstated on different systems, instead of on a private computer. The workflow is excellent, but difficult to implement for non-programmers. WORCS instead uses a much more lightweight approach to safeguard computational reproducibility under *most circumstances*. This should be sufficient for most users, but can also be combined with Peikert and Brandmaier if strict computational reproducibility is essential. WORCS thus addresses a unique issue not covered by existing solutions, namely to provide a workflow most conducive to satisfying the TOP-guidelines. Still, it can be combined with existing approaches.

## Introducing the tools

WORCS relies on a few free, open source software solutions that, when combined, facilitate meeting the TOP-guidelines related to citation, sharing, and preregistration. The first tool is *dynamic document generation*. Dynamic document generation (DDG) means writing scientific reports in a format that interleaves written reports with blocks of computer code used to conduct the analyses. The text is automatically formatted as an APA-style manuscript, and results of the code blocks are automatically generated and insterted in the text, or rendered as Figures and Tables. Dynamic document generation supercedes the classical approach of using separate programs to write prose and conduct analyses, and then manually copy-pasting analysis results into the text. Although there is a slight learning curve to transitioning to DDG, the investment really pays off: First, the time saved from painstakingly copy-pasting output and manually formatting text soon outweighs the investment of switching to a new program; second, human error in copy-pasting results is eliminated; third, when revisions require major changes to the analyses, all results, Figures and Tables are automatically updated; and finally, flexibility in output formats means that a manuscript can be rendered to presentation format, or even to a website. In sum, while writing academic papers in a programming environment might seem counter-intuitive at first, this approach is much more amenable to the needs of academics than most word processing software. It prevents mistakes, and saves time.

The second tool is *version control*: Maintaining an indelible log of every change to all project files. Version control is a near-essential tool for scientific reproducibility, as anyone learns who has had the experience of accidentally deleting a crucial file, or of being unable to reproduce analyses because they ran some analyses interactively instead of using syntax. Many scientists use some form of *implicit* version control; for example, by renaming files after major changes (e.g., "manuscript_final_2.2-2019-10-12.doc"), tracking changes in word processing software, or using cloud hosting services that retain backups of previous versions. WORCS instead uses the *explicit* version control software "Git". Git tracks changes to files, and stores these changes when the user makes a "commit". Git retains a complete log of all commits, and users can compare changes between different commits, or go back to a previous version of the code (for example, after making a mistake, or to replicate a previous version of the results). A project version controlled with Git is called a "Repository", or Repo.

<!--In statistical consultations, I often hear that researchers are unable to reproduce specific results because they only worked with a "very specific" version of the syntax - usually a combination of -->

The functionality of Git is amplified by services such as GitHub (other services are available). GitHub is best understood as a cloud storage service with social networking functionality. The "cloud storage" aspect of GitHub works as follows: You can "clone" a local Git repository to the GitHub website, as a backup or research archive. The "social network" aspect comes into play when the project is set to "public": This allows other researchers to peruse the repository on the GitHub website to see how the work was done, clone it to their own computer to replicate the original work or apply the methods to their own data, open Issues to ask questions or give feedback on the project, or even send a "Pull request" with changes to the text or code for your consideration. Git and GitHub shine as tools for collaboration, because different people can simultaneously work on different parts of a project, and their changes can be compared and automatically merged on the website. Even on solo projects, working with Git/GitHub has many benefits: Staying organized, being able to start a new study with a clone of an old, similar repository, or splitting off an "experimental branch" to try something new, while retaining the ability to revert to a previous state of the project, or to merge the experimental branch.

The third tool is *dependency management*: Keeping track of exactly what software was used to conduct the analyses. <!-- Being able to replicate analyses requires not only access to the data and analysis code, but also to the software used to evaluate that code.--> At first glance, it might seem sufficient to state that analyses were conducted in *Program X*. However, every program is susceptible to changes and updates. R-packages in particular are updated frequently, because they are Open Source, and there is an active community of developers contributing functionality and bugfixes. Potentially, any update could change the results of the code. For example, R-version 3.6.0 fixed a bug in the random number generator. This means that any analyses that use random numbers, such as bootstrapping, cannot be strictly replicated from previous versions.

Many solutions exist to ensure computational reproducibility. These solutions typically work by enveloping your research project in a distinct "environment" that only has access to programs that are explicitly installed, and maintaining a record of these programs. These solutions differ in user-friendliness and effectiveness. If strict reproducibility is required, one might use the aforementioned workflow by @peikertReproducibleDataAnalysis2019, which runs all analyses inside a virtual machine. This is quite effective, but very difficult to set up. A slightly less sophisticated solution is offered by the R-package `packrat`, which installs all software used in a project to a dedicated library that can be stored and copied with the project. This solution is reasonably user-friendly and effective, but has the disadvantage that for each project, all packages must be installed anew, which can take a long time (in my case, hours) and a lot of hard drive space. Moreover, Git/GitHub is not designed to store your entire project library, so `packrat` does not address the issue of how other users are supposed to get access to your library. In conclusion, `packrat` is somewhat unwieldy. The package `checkpoint` offers an extremely lightweight solution: Instead of storing all software used, it simply records the calendar date, and then installs the version of all required packages that was available on the central R repository `CRAN` on that date from an archival website. Thus, all that is needed to restore a project is the date on which it was conducted. This is very user-friendly, and reasonably effective - the only problem is that this solution is limited to `CRAN` packages, and cannot mix package versions from different dates.

A recently developed package strikes a great balance between user-friendliness and effectiveness: `renv`, developed by the team behind Rstudio. This package maintains a text-based log file of which packages are used, in what versions, and where they were installed from (e.g., CRAN, Bioconductor, GitHub). Being text-based, this log can be version controlled with Git. On a local computer, `renv` installs all packages used in a cache that is shared between all projects that use `renv`. Thus, if one of your projects uses a version of a package that is already in the cache, it does not need to be installed again. This overcomes the limitations of long installation times and large space requirements of `renv`. When someone else loads your project, `renv` will install all of the required packages onto a cache on their computer. Whereas `packrat` copies the source code of all packages, `renv` obtains the packages from their original repositories. Thus, as long as these repositories used maintain their archives, this solution is very lightweight and effective. It is not foolproof, but some have argued that all solutions for computational reproducibility have a limited shelf life [@brownHowLearnedStop2017]. Ultimately, the best solution might be to use a good-enough solution, like `renv`, and acknowledge that all code requires some maintenance if you want to reproduce it in the future.

## Additional considerations

A few additional considerations were considered in developing WORCS. The first consideration is to develop a workflow for R, instead of for SPSS or Python. Several arguments support the choice to work in R. First, R and all of it extensions are free and Open Source, and Open Source software should be the tool of choice for Open Science. Second, all of the aforementioned tools for an Open Science workflow are implemented in R. In general, many statistical methods are first implemented in R, as there is a vibrant online community developing new R-packages and providing support and tutorials for existing ones. Third, at the time of writing, R is the second-most cited statistical software package [@PopularityDataScience2012], following SPSS, which has no support for any of the tools discussed in this paper. Finally, R is highly interoperable: Packages are available to load nearly every imaginable filetype, code written in other programming languages [including Python, @allaireMarkdownPythonEngine] can be called from R, and output can be written to many file types, including DOCX and PDF (in APA style), and HTML format. Working with R is simplified immensely by using the Rstudio user interface for R. Rstudio integrates many of the tools used in WORCS in a user-friendly manner, and automates and streamlines many tedious or complicated aspects of working with R. This renders Rstudio a catch-all solution for generating open, reproducible code.

Another consideration is to develop a workflow that relies on text-based files only. These files can be read by machines and humans alike, without requiring special (licensed) software. Text-based files are also small, can be version-controlled with Git (binary files should not be version controlled), and can be perused online in repositories such as GitHub.

<!--

- Use RStudio projects to bundle analyses and writing into a self-contained unit
- Use text-based files only
    * `.R` for analyses
    * `.Rmd` for documents
    * `.csv` for data
- Version control all these files with Git
- Ensure full reproducibility of the R environment with the `renv` package, which takes a snapshot of all packages used (and their version numbers), and can restore this configuration on a new system
- Publish the entire self-contained research unit on GitHub
- Connect this GitHub repository to an OSF project


Using text-based files has the advantage that they can be read by machines and humans without requiring special (licensed) software. Text-based files are also small, can be version-controlled with Git, and can be readily uploaded to online repositories.

## Open science as opportunity

Sometimes, Open Science principles are discussed as a kind of "antidote" to scientific misconduct. Yet these principles also present an opportunity to conduct more reliable research, with fewer mistakes, more convenient collaboration, more effective internal and external collaboration, and the potential for crowd-sourced error correction. 


## How WORCS meets the goals of Open Science

### Comprehensive citation

TOP encourages comprehensive citation of literature, data, materials, methods, and software. In principle, researchers can meet this requirement by simply citing every reference used. In practice, however, print journals often discourage comprehensive citation due to space constraints. <!--either actively, or passively by including the reference list in the manuscript word count.--> Researchers can nonetheless meet the  comprehensive citation requirement by preparing two versions of the manuscript: A version with comprehensive citations for online dissemination (e.g., through preprint servers), and a print version that includes only essential citations. The Open Science statement in the print version should address the fact that additional references are available in the online version, e.g.:

> In the spirit of Open Science, an online repository is available for this manuscript at XXX, which contains more comprehensive citations, the data, analysis code, new research materials, and pre-registration forms.

The `worcs` package includes functions that can be used render a manuscript with, or without, comprehensive citations. The procedure to use these functions is:

1. During writing, maintain a plain-text `.bib` file with the BibTeX references for all citations.
  + You can make this file by hand; e.g., Figure \@ref(fig:scholarbib) shows how to obtain a BibTeX reference from Google Scholar; simply copy-paste each reference into the `.bib` file
  + You can export a `.bib` file from most reference manager programs; the free, open-source reference manager [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/download/) is excellent and user-friendly. [Here](https://christopherjunk.netlify.com/blog/2019/02/25/zotero-rmarkdown/) is a tutorial for using Zotero with Rmarkdown.
2. To cite a reference, use the `citekey` - the first word in the BibTeX entry for that reference. Insert it in the Rmarkdown file like so: `@yourcitekey2020`. For a parenthesized reference, use `[@citekeyone2020; @citekeytwo2020]`. For more options, see the [Rmarkdown cookbook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/bibliography.html).
3. To indicate a *non-essential* citation, mark it with a double at-symbol: `@@nonessential2020`.
4. When Knitting the document, adapt the `knit` command in the YAML header.  
  `knit: worcs::cite_all` renders all citations, and  
  `knit: worcs::cite_essential` removes all *non-essential* citations.
5. Optional: To be extremely thorough, you could make a "branch" of the Github repository for the print version of the manuscript. Only in this branch, you use the function `knit: worcs::cite_essential`. The procedure is documented in [this tutorial](http://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/142364_3b344a38149b465c8ebc9a8cd2eee3aa.html).

```

<!--1) use comprehensive citation, 2) document which citations are essential, and 3) publishing a pre-print with comprehensive citations, and 4) filtering out non-essential citations for the print version, and referencing the repository with the pre-print.


To facilitate the citation of data, researchers can publish a data paper in specialized journals, such as the [*Journal of Open Psychology Data*](https://openpsychologydata.metajnl.com/), or publish their data in an online repository - such as a GitHub repository - and include a text file with the preferred citation for the data, and the license that applies to the data, such as Creative Commons [BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) or [BY-NC-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).

### Data sharing

Data sharing is important for computational reproducibility and secondary analysis. Computational reproducibility means that a third party can exactly recreate the results from the raw data, using the published analysis code. Secondary analysis means that a third party can conduct sensitivity analyses, expliore alternative explanations, or even use existing data to answer a different research question. From an open science perspective, data sharing is always desirable. From a practical point of view, it is not always possible. Data sharing may be impeded by legal constraints, ethical restrictions, absence of informed consent for data sharing, and privacy concerns. In some cases, it is difficult or impossible to share data.

When data can be shared, it is important to version control the (anonymized/pseudonymized) raw data upon collection, and avoid changing it. Any data processing steps should be documented in the code, instead of applying them to the raw data file. This way, the code will be a pipeline from the raw data to the published results.

When data cannot be shared, researchers should aim to safeguard the potential for computational reproducibility and secondary analysis as much as possible. WORCS uses two solutions to accomplish this goal. The first solution is publishing a *checksum* of the raw data upon collection. A checksum is a 32-character summary of a file of any size. Any change to the underlying file results in a different checksum. Thus, one can use a checksum to verify that the contents of a file remain unchanged. If researchers publish the checksum of their raw data and the complete analysis code, then they can prove to an independent auditer that running the public analysis code on the private dataset with the correct checksum results in the published results of their work.

The second solution is to share a synthetic dataset with similar characteristics to the real data. Synthetic data typically mimic the level of measurement and (conditional) distributions of the real data, but complex multivariate relationships are often lost. Thus, analyses on the synthetic data should not be substantively interpreted, and findings from the real data might not be replicated in the synthetic data. Still, sharing synthetic data allows any third party to 1) verify that the published code runs, 2) debug the code, and 3) write valid code for alternative analyses. A third party can send this code to the original authors, who evaluate it on the real data, and send back the results. The ["Pull request"](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) functionality on GitHub is a particularly user-friendly way to do this.

The `worcs` package includes three convenience functions to facilitate working with open and closed data. These functions are:

* `open_data(data)`: This function on a data object (a `data.frame` or `matrix`) generates a file called `data.csv`, updates the `.gitignore` file to stop ignoring this specific `.csv` file, and writes a checksum for this data file to `checksums.csv`.
* `closed_data(data)`: This function generates a file called `data.csv` and a synthetic dataset called `synthetic_data.csv`, updates the `.gitignore` file to stop ignoring `synthetic_data.csv` file, and writes a checksum for the real data file to `checksums.csv`.
* `load_data()`: This function loads the real data if it is available (i.e., the file `data.csv` exists, and its checksum is correct), and otherwise, loads the synthetic data.

The WORCS-template additionally creates a file called `prepare_data.R`. This file is intended to document any steps that must be taken to get your data *into* R, and that are not intended to be repeated when re-running the analyses. Use this file to report any preprocessing required to obtain a neat `data.frame`. For example, if the data was originally in SPSS format, this file might just contain the code required to read the SPSS file. Typically, the last line of the `prepare_data.R` file will be `open_data()` or `closed_data()`. The proper analysis code will then start with `load_data()`.

### Sharing code, research materials, design and analysis

(3), sharing new research materials (4), and design and analysis (5); pre-registration of studies before data collection (6), and pre-registration of the analysis plan prior to analysis 

### Preregistration

Lindsay [-@lindsayResearchPreregistration1012016] defines preregistration as "creating a permanent record of your study plans before you look at the data. The plan is stored in a date-stamped, uneditable file in a secure online archive." Two such archives are well-known in the social sciences: AsPredicted.org, and OSF.io. However, GitHub also conforms to these standards. Thus, it is possible to preregister a study simply by pushing a text document with the study plans to GitHub. If the GitHub repository is Public, the preregistration is immediately visible to the world, and Reviewers can submit comments through pull requests. If the repository is Private, Reviewers can be invited as "Collaborators", although this removes their anonymity. Private repositories can be made public at a later date, along with their entire time-stamped history. 

Which studies can be preregistered is a matter of some debate. Some have taken the position that studies can only be preregistered prior to data collection. This is the only way to ensure that a researcher is not "HARKing": Hypothesizing after the results are known. From this point of view, it makes little 

#### Preregistering study plans

Several excellent preregistration templates are available in the R-package `prereg` [@austPreregMarkdownTemplates2019], including templates from AsPredicted.org, OSF.io, and from individual researchers [e.g., @vantveerPreregistrationSocialPsychology2016]. When opening a new Rstudio project with the WORCS project template, it is possible to select one of these preregistration templates, which will generate a file called `preregistration.Rmd`. This file should be used to document study plans, ideally prior to data collection.

#### Preregistering analyses

The ideal preregistered analysis consists of a complete analysis script that can be evaluated once the data are obtained. This ideal is often unattainable, because the data present researchers with unanticipated challenges; e.g., assumptions are violated, or analyses work differently than expected. Some of these challenges can be avoided by simulating the data one expects to obtain, and writing the analysis syntax based on the simulated data. This topic is beyond the scope of the present paper, but many user-friendly methods for simulating data are available in `R`, including the package [`simstudy`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/simstudy/vignettes/simstudy.html). When using the WORCS-workflow, it is recommended to preregister, if possible, a `.R` script with the planned analyses, along with a verbal, conceptual description. If any changes must be made to the R-script after obtaining the data, one can refer to the conceptual description to explain why these changes are necessary.

WORCS uses the following approach to preregistration:

1. Document study plans in a `.Rmd` file, and planned analyses in a `.R` file.
2. Commit these documents to the local Git repository, and push them to GitHub
3. On GitHub, [tag the release](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/creating-releases) as "Preregistration". A tagged release helps others retrieve this commit.
4. Optional: Upload the files as attachments to another pre-registration repository, e.g., AsPredicted.org or OSF.io.
  + The `.Rmd` file can be Knitted to a PDF form before uploading to a repository

<!--
3. Write conceptual preregistration

3. Commit, push, and tag th as preregistration

4. Optional: Add Materials to repository. It is possible to solicit feedback (through issue/pull request) and later acknowledge outside contributions
4. Collect data and either add to repository, or register hash of raw datafile
5. Conduct analyses and write; commit regularly (ideally, after completing a small and clearly defined task), with informative commit messages. Call renv::snapshot() to save the state of the project library to the lockfile (called renv.lock),
6. Create OSF project, connect to GitHub, mention OSF page in manuscript
7. Optional: Publish preprint in a not-for-profit preprint repository (check Sherpa Romeo) http://sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/index.php
7. Submit
8. Make repository public -->

WORCS helps researchers meet each of these guidelines, with one exception: We do not address replication of published results, because that pertains to the topic of research, instead of its execution. We group the remaining seven guidelines into three categories: Citation (1), sharing (2-4), and preregistration (6-7).

# Workflow for Open Reproducible Code in Science

## Preparing your system

Before you can use the WORCS workflow, you have to install the required software, and register for a GitHub account. The setup process is documented in a vignette included with the `worcs` R-package, and also [available online](https://cjvanlissa.github.io/worcs/articles/setup.html).

## Phase 1: Study design

1. Create a new Private repository on github, copy the https:// link to clipboard  
  The link should look something like https://github.com/yourname/yourrepo.git
2. In Rstudio, click File > New Project > New directory > WORCS Project Template
    a. Paste the GitHub Repository address in the textbox
    b. Keep the checkbox for `renv` checked if you want to document all dependencies (recommended)
    c. Select a preregistration template
3. Write the preregistration `.Rmd`
4. In the top-right corner of Rstudio, select the Git tab, select the checkboxes next to all files, and click the Commit button. Write an informative message for the commit, e.g., "Preregistration", again click Commit, and then click the green Push arrow to send your commit to GitHub
5. Go to the GitHub repository for this project, and tag the Commit as a preregistration
6. Optional: Render the preregistration to PDF, and upload it to AsPredicted.org or OSF.io as an attachment
7. Optional: Add study Materials (to which you own the rights) to the repository. It is possible to solicit feedback (by opening a GitHub Issue) and acknowledge outside contributions (by accepting Pull requests)

## Phase 2: Data analysis

8. Read the data into R, and document this procedure in `prepare_data.R`
9. Use `open_data()` or `closed_data()` to store the data
10. Write the manuscript in `Manuscript.Rmd`, using code chunks to perform the analyses.
11. Regularly commit your progress to the Git repository; ideally, after completing each small and clearly defined task. Use informative commit messages. Push the commits to GitHub.
12. Cite essential references with one at-symbol (`[@essentialref2020]`), and non-essential references with a double at-symbol (`[@@nonessential2020]`).

## Phase 3: Paper submission

13. To save the state of the project library (all packages used), call `renv::snapshot()`. This updates the lockfile, `renv.lock`.
14. To render the paper with essential citations only for submission, change the line `knit: worcs::cite_all` to `knit: worcs::cite_essential`. Then, press the Knit button to generate a PDF

## Phase 4: Publication

Note that some researchers take these steps at an earlier stage. However, for newcomers to Open Science, who are unsure about potential implications for the publication of their work, it might be prudent to perform these actions after acceptance, and before publication:

13. Make the GitHub repository public
14. [Create an OSF project](https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019737594-Create-a-Project); although you may have already done this in Step 6.
15. [Connect your GitHub repository to the OSF project](https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019929813-Connect-GitHub-to-a-Project)
16. Add an Open Science statement to the manuscript, with a link to the OSF project
17. Optional: [Publish preprint in a not-for-profit preprint repository such as PsyArchiv, and connect it to your existing OSF project](https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019930533-Upload-a-Preprint)
    + Check [Sherpa Romeo](http://sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/index.php) to be sure that your intended outlet allows the publication of preprints; many journals do, nowadays - and if they do not, it is worth considering other outlets.


<!-- Now, the worcs package adds a template to Rstudio
